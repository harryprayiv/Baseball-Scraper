A simple scraper written in Python with Selenium, Beautiful Soup.  
A terminal application which scrapes and outputs clean player data from a specific year as json files.  The goal here is to correlate the player id system for CBS, MLB, ESPN, and others for use in a meta scraper.  I can only record so much information manually.

A little side project using appropriate tools.
